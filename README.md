Student mark Database 

#Task to complete 

1) Implement the function my_strcpy() and my_strcmp() which implement the same functions as strcpy() and strcmp() from the C standard library. 

2) Implement a function that adds two dimensional matrixes. The signature of the function is:
   void add_matrices(int m1[][], int m2[][], int destination_matrix[][], int n_rows, n_columns)
3) Implement a program to manage student marks. The menu to the user should be:
         1) Introduce new student
         2) Introduce Mark
         3) Print report of all students
     you should keep student records in an array of structs. Each element of the array should have the following fields
         - Name
         - Student number
         - Array of course marks (floas)
    For simplicity courses have a number of 0 to N. You donâ€™t need to manage course names.
